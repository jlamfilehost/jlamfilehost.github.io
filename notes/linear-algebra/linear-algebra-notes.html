### Basic vector definitions

**vector**:
- informal: a quantity with a magnitude and a direction
- formal: any element of a vector space

Examples: force, velocity, acceleration, displacement

For this course, we deal mostly with 2D and 3D vectors, although we will also work with arbitrary nD vectors.

**scalar**: a quantity with magnitude only

A 2D or 3D vector may be represented by an arrow with length corresponding to the vector's magnitude, direction same as that of the vector.
- Note that arrow has a starting and ending position, which do not exist in a vector

**standard position**: when the tail of a vector lies at the origin

---

### Adding vectors (geometrically)

Only vectors from the same space (dimensionality) can be added.

**tip-to-tail addition**: geometric version of vector addition, put head of one of first addend to the tail of the second; the vector sum has the same tail as the first addend and the same head as the second
- Using tip-to-tail diagram and reversing the order of addends makes it easy to see that the two are commutative; i.e., the resulting diagram forms a parallelogram, which meet at the tail and the head of the vector sum

**zero vector**: a vector with length 0 and no direction
- Note that this is not the same thing as 0 (the scalar value)

$\vec{0}+\vec{v}=\vec{v}+\vec{0}=\vec{v}$

$-\vec{v}$: a vector with same magnitude as $\vec{v}$ but opposite direction

$-\vec{v}+\vec{v}=\vec{0}$

---

### Subtracting vectors (geometrically)

Define: $\vec{v}-\vec{w}=\vec{v}+(-\vec{w})$

Note that $\vec{w}+(\vec{v}-\vec{w})=\vec{v}$, i.e., the difference is what you add to $\vec{w}$ to get $\vec{v}$. If both vectors are given with the same starting point, then the difference is the vector whose tail is at the head of $\vec{w}$ and whose head is at the head of $\vec{v}$.

---

### Scaling vectors (geometrically)

Let k be the scale factor.
- Case 1: $k>0$, $\vec{v}\neq\vec{0}$
$k\vec{v}$ is vector whose magnitude is k times the magnitude of $\vec{v}$ and whose direction is the same as the direction of $\vec{v}$.
- Case 2: $k<0$, $\vec{v}\neq\vec{0}$
$k\vec{v}$ is vector whose magnitude is k times the magnitude of $\vec{v}$ and whose direction is the opposite as the direction of $\vec{v}$.
- Case 3: $k=0$ or $\vec{v}=\vec{0}$
$k\vec{v}=\vec{0}$

---

### Linear combination

**linear combination**: If $\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},\ldots\vec{v_n}$ are vectors of the same dimensionality, and c_1, c_2, ... c_n are scalars, then the vector sum $c_1\vec{v_1}+c_2\vec{v_2}+\ldots+c_n\vec{v_n}$ is called the linear combination of the set ${\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},\ldots\vec{v_n}}$.
- The combination of the empty set is $\vec{0}$.

**span**: of a set of vectors is the collection of all linear combinations of the set
- If standard position enforced, span of a single vector is a line unless $\vec{v}=\vec{0}$.
- If standard position enforced and $\vec{v_1}\neq k\vec{v_2}$, span of a set of two vectors is a plane.
    - The vectors create a non-orthagonal grid, which can be used as a coordinate system to represent any point on the plane. Sometimes, just the coefficients of the two vectors will be listed (similar to how coordinates are listed as $(x,y)$. The two vectors are called the **basis**, and a coordinate on the plane is represented like so: $\begin{bmatrix}3\\ -2\end{bmatrix}_B$

---

### Vector components

$\vec{v}=\langle x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1\rangle$, if $(x_1,y_1)$ are the coordinates of the vector's tail and $(x_2,y_2)$ are the coordinates of the vector's head.
- If standard position, $\vec{v}=\langle x,y\rangle$.

Adding in component form means adding components. If $\vec{v}=\langle x_1,y_1\rangle$ and $\vec{w}=\langle x_2,y_2\rangle$, $\vec{v+w}=\langle x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2\rangle$.

Scaling in component form means multiplying components by scalar. If k is the scalar and $\vec{v}=\langle x,y\rangle$, $k\vec{v}=\langle kx,ky\rangle$.

### 3.3 Orthagonal Decomposition

**Note**: This is a very important topic and will definitely come up on the first test and cumulative final. Memorize the formula for the projection and the orthagonal vector.

Given two arbitrary vectors $\vec{a}\neq\vec{0}$ and $\vec{u}$. It helps to give both vectors the same starting point for visualization.

Orthagonal decomposition can be thought of as the following: Find two vectors, $\vec{w_1}$ and $\vec{w_2}$, such that:

- $\vec{w_1}+\vec{w_2}=\vec{u}$
- $\vec{w_1}\parallel\vec{a}$.
- $\vec{w_2}\perp\vec{a}$

In other words, find two vectors that sum to $\vec{u}$, such that one is parallel to and one is orthagonal to $\vec{a}$.

Note that:

- $\vec{a}\perp\vec{u}\Rightarrow\vec{w_1}=\vec{0},\vec{w_2}=\vec{u}$
- $\vec{a}\parallel\vec{u}\Rightarrow\vec{w_1}=\vec{u},\vec{w_2}=\vec{0}$
- If $\vec{a}\cdot\vec{u}<0$ (if the angle between the vectors is obtuse), $\vec{w_1}$ goes in the opposite direction of $\vec{a}$ (and vice versa when $\vec{a}\cdot\vec{u}>0)$

Formula proof for $\vec{w_1}$ and $\vec{w_2}$ (memorize final equations):

> Since $\vec{w_1}\parallel\vec{a}$, $\vec{w_1}=k\vec{a}$ for some scalar $k$. (This is true without the reciprocal statement because $\vec{a}\neq\vec{0}$ is given).
> $\vec{u}=k\vec{a}+\vec{w_2}$
> $\vec{u}\cdot\vec{a}=(k\vec{a}+\vec{w_2})\cdot\vec{a}$
> $=k(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{a})+\vec{w_2}\cdot\vec{a}$
> $=k\Vert\vec{a}\Vert^2+0=k\Vert\vec{a}\Vert^2$
> $\Rightarrow k=\frac{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{a}}{\Vert\vec{a}\Vert^2}$
> $\Rightarrow\vec{w_1}=\frac{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{a}}{\Vert\vec{a}\Vert^2}\vec{a},\vec{w_2}=\vec{u}-\frac{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{a}}{\Vert\vec{a}\Vert^2}\vec{a}$

Here are the more formal terms for which $\vec{w_1}$ and $\vec{w_2}$ have been serving as placeholders:

- **(orthagonal) projection of $\vec{u}$ onto $\vec{a}$**: $\text{proj}_{\vec{a}}\vec{u}=\vec{w_1}=\frac{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{a}}{\Vert\vec{a}\Vert^2}\vec{a}$
- **vector component of $\vec{u}\perp\vec{a}$**: $\vec{w_2}=\vec{u}-\frac{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{a}}{\Vert\vec{a}\Vert^2}\vec{a}$

Note that all orthagonal decomposition happens in a plane in space, so this can be applied to any two vectors in the same N-dimensional space.

### Point-normal form of a plane

Any plane in 3-space can be specified by a **normal vector** (vector orthagonal to the plane that is not $\vec{0}$) and a point that lies on the plane.

To derive the equation of a plane in **point-normal form**:

> $P_0=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is the given point that lies on the plane, $P=(x,y,z)$ is an arbitrary point on the plane, and $\vec{n}=\langle a,b,c\rangle$ is the vector normal to the plane.
> $\vec{P_0P}\perp\vec{n}\Rightarrow\vec{n}\cdot\vec{P_0P}=0$
> $a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)+c(z-z_0)=0$ (point-normal form of a plane)

The **general form** of a plane may be done by collecting constants into another constant $d$:

> $ax-ax_0+by-by_0+cz-cz_0=0$
> Let $d=-ax_0-by_0-cz_0$
> $ax+by+cz+d=0$ (general form of a plane)

Either general form or point-normal form can be used to find a normal vector to the plane (its components are the coefficients of $x,y,z$) and find a point on the plane ($x_0,y_0,z_0$ given in point-normal form; requires factoring in general form).

Note that while either form denotes a unique plane in space, the same plane has infinitely many correct point-normal forms (and general forms) if differnet normal vectors or starting points are chosen.

*Application: Use three points to find point-normal form of plane.*

> Another way to uniquely identify a plane is by identifying three unique, non-collinear points on that plane. The three points can be used to find the point-normal form of the plane.
> Three points, P, Q, and R are given.
> First, the noncollinearity of the points must be tested. If $\vec{PQ}\not\parallel\vec{PR}$ (or any combination of two connecting vectors), then the points are noncollinear.
> To find the normal vector, we will have to satisfy the linear system of equations: $\begin{cases}\vec{n}\cdot\vec{PQ}=0\newline\vec{n}\cdot\vec{PR}=0\end{cases}$.
> This may require substitution of easy numbers for the components of $\vec{n}$ as necessary to easily solve for a particular solution. Remember that any scalar multiple of the normal vector is a valid solution to this system of equations, so by setting one component of $\vec{n}$ to a non-zero value (assuming the component is not 0), this will help find a specific normal vector.
> Once the normal vector has been found, use it and one of the given points to write a point-normal equation for the plane.

**Vector form of a plane**

If the points $P_0$ and $P$ are represented as position vectors $\vec{r_0}$ and $\vec{r}$ (respectively), the equation for a plane in **vector form** is $\vec{n}\cdot(\vec{r}-\vec{r_0})$.

### Point-normal form of a line

The point-normal form of a plane can be reduced to 2-space as the equation of a line.

The **point-normal form of a line** is $a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)=0$. Similar to standard form linear equations, this has the advantage (over point-slope or slope-intercept forms) of being able to express vertical lines. The normal vector to this line is $\langle a,b\rangle$.
