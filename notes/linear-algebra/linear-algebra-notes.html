### Basic vector definitions

**vector**:
- informal: a quantity with a magnitude and a direction
- formal: any element of a vector space

Examples: force, velocity, acceleration, displacement

For this course, we deal mostly with 2D and 3D vectors, although we will also work with arbitrary nD vectors.

**scalar**: a quantity with magnitude only

A 2D or 3D vector may be represented by an arrow with length corresponding to the vector's magnitude, direction same as that of the vector.
- Note that arrow has a starting and ending position, which do not exist in a vector

**standard position**: when the tail of a vector lies at the origin

### Adding vectors (geometrically)

Only vectors from the same space (dimensionality) can be added.

**tip-to-tail addition**: geometric version of vector addition, put head of one of first addend to the tail of the second; the vector sum has the same tail as the first addend and the same head as the second

- Using tip-to-tail diagram and reversing the order of addends makes it easy to see that the two are commutative; i.e., the resulting diagram forms a parallelogram, which meet at the tail and the head of the vector sum

**zero vector**: a vector with length 0 and no direction
- Note that this is not the same thing as 0 (the scalar value)

$\vec{0}+\vec{v}=\vec{v}+\vec{0}=\vec{v}$

$-\vec{v}$: a vector with same magnitude as $\vec{v}$ but opposite direction

$-\vec{v}+\vec{v}=\vec{0}$

---

### Subtracting vectors (geometrically)

Define: $\vec{v}-\vec{w}=\vec{v}+(-\vec{w})$

Note that $\vec{w}+(\vec{v}-\vec{w})=\vec{v}$, i.e., the difference is what you add to $\vec{w}$ to get $\vec{v}$. If both vectors are given with the same starting point, then the difference is the vector whose tail is at the head of $\vec{w}$ and whose head is at the head of $\vec{v}$.

---

### Scaling vectors (geometrically)

Let k be the scale factor.

- Case 1: $k>0$, $\vec{v}\neq\vec{0}$
$k\vec{v}$ is vector whose magnitude is k times the magnitude of $\vec{v}$ and whose direction is the same as the direction of $\vec{v}$.

- Case 2: $k<0$, $\vec{v}\neq\vec{0}$
$k\vec{v}$ is vector whose magnitude is k times the magnitude of $\vec{v}$ and whose direction is the opposite as the direction of $\vec{v}$.

- Case 3: $k=0$ or $\vec{v}=\vec{0}$
$k\vec{v}=\vec{0}$
