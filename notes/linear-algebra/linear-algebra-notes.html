### Basic vector definitions

**vector**:
- informal: a quantity with a magnitude and a direction
- formal: any element of a vector space

Examples: force, velocity, acceleration, displacement

For this course, we deal mostly with 2D and 3D vectors, although we will also work with arbitrary nD vectors.

**scalar**: a quantity with magnitude only

A 2D or 3D vector may be represented by an arrow with length corresponding to the vector's magnitude, direction same as that of the vector.
- Note that arrow has a starting and ending position, which do not exist in a vector

**standard position**: when the tail of a vector lies at the origin

### Adding vectors (geometrically)

Only vectors from the same space (dimensionality) can be added.

**tip-to-tail addition**: geometric version of vector addition, put head of one of first addend to the tail of the second; the vector sum has the same tail as the first addend and the same head as the second
- Using tip-to-tail diagram and reversing the order of addends makes it easy to see that the two are commutative; i.e., the resulting diagram forms a parallelogram, which meet at the tail and the head of the vector sum

**zero vector**: a vector with length 0 and no direction
- Note that this is not the same thing as 0 (the scalar value)

$\vec{0}+\vec{v}=\vec{v}+\vec{0}=\vec{v}$

$-\vec{v}$: a vector with same magnitude as $\vec{v}$ but opposite direction

$-\vec{v}+\vec{v}=\vec{0}$

---

### Subtracting vectors (geometrically)

Define: $\vec{v}-\vec{w}=\vec{v}+(-\vec{w})$

Note that $\vec{w}+(\vec{v}-\vec{w})=\vec{v}$, i.e., the difference is what you add to $\vec{w}$ to get $\vec{v}$. If both vectors are given with the same starting point, then the difference is the vector whose tail is at the head of $\vec{w}$ and whose head is at the head of $\vec{v}$.

### Scaling vectors (geometrically)

Let k be the scale factor.
- Case 1: $k>0$, $\vec{v}\neq\vec{0}$
$k\vec{v}$ is vector whose magnitude is k times the magnitude of $\vec{v}$ and whose direction is the same as the direction of $\vec{v}$.
- Case 2: $k<0$, $\vec{v}\neq\vec{0}$
$k\vec{v}$ is vector whose magnitude is k times the magnitude of $\vec{v}$ and whose direction is the opposite as the direction of $\vec{v}$.
- Case 3: $k=0$ or $\vec{v}=\vec{0}$
$k\vec{v}=\vec{0}$

---

### Linear combination

**linear combination**: If $\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},\ldots\vec{v_n}$ are vectors of the same dimensionality, and c_1, c_2, ... c_n are scalars, then the vector sum $c_1\vec{v_1}+c_2\vec{v_2}+\ldots+c_n\vec{v_n}$ is called the linear combination of the set ${\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},\ldots\vec{v_n}}$.
- The combination of the empty set is $\vec{0}$.

**span**: of a set of vectors is the collection of all linear combinations of the set
- If standard position enforced, span of a single vector is a line unless $\vec{v}=\vec{0}$.
- If standard position enforced and $\vec{v_1}\neq k\vec{v_2}$, span of a set of two vectors is a plane.
    - The vectors create a non-orthagonal grid, which can be used as a coordinate system to represent any point on the plane. Sometimes, just the coefficients of the two vectors will be listed (similar to how coordinates are listed as $(x,y)$. The two vectors are called the **basis**, and a coordinate on the plane is represented like so: $\begin{bmatrix}3\\ -2\end{bmatrix}_B$

---

### Vector components

$\vec{v}=\langle x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1\rangle$, if $(x_1,y_1)$ are the coordinates of the vector's tail and $(x_2,y_2)$ are the coordinates of the vector's head.
- If standard position, $\vec{v}=\langle x,y\rangle$.

Adding in component form means adding components. If $\vec{v}=\langle x_1,y_1\rangle$ and $\vec{w}=\langle x_2,y_2\rangle$, $\vec{v+w}=\langle x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2\rangle$.

Scaling in component form means multiplying components by scalar. If k is the scalar and $\vec{v}=\langle x,y\rangle$, $k\vec{v}=\langle kx,ky\rangle$.
